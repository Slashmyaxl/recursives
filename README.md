# recursives

This assignment, calling for two functions - one which returns an array, length n, of the Fibonacci sequence and another which returns a sorted list using merge sort - will enable me to practice both iterative and recursive functions.

I will also experiment with executing ".js" files in the command line with Node and so this repo will ultimately be without a ".html" file.
